# PhilzCoffeeData

This repo is aimed at answering the question: Does my huband spend an exorbitant amount of money at Philz Coffee? 

To answer this question, I obtained Philz App User data via the California Consumer Privacy Act for one user to anaylze and visualize the user data. Here are the steps I took: 

  1. Contact Philz App to retrieve user data through the CCPA. 
      Here are the steps to request your data through the app: 
          More > Legal > Privacy Policy > Scroll down to 'Requests' 
      Using these steps, any active Philz App user in California can request the data that the Philz app collects.
