# PhilzCoffeeData

This repo is aimed at answering the question: Does my huband spend an exorbitant amount of money at Philz Coffee? 

To answer this question, I obtained Philz App User data via the California Consumer Privacy Act for one user to anaylze and visualize the user data. Here are the steps I took: 

  1. Contact Philz App to retrieve user data through the CCPA. 
      Here are the steps to request your data through the app: 
          More > Legal > Privacy Policy > Scroll down to 'Requests' 
      Using these steps, any active Philz App user in California can request the data that the Philz app collects. The raw data set is uploaded in this repo.  

  2. Data Cleaning 
      After recieving the Philz App data, the first step was to tidy the dataset in a usable format. The R code in this repo was used to clean the data.


  3.  Data Visualization in Data Google Studio. Import clean data set into data google studio to visualize data. The dashboard with this cleaned data can be found          here: https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/b2b8bf63-c7ab-4327-963f-c09715bc1a11


So, does my husband spend exobitantly at Philz Coffee?
