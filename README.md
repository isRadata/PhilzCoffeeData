# PhilzCoffeeData

This repo is aimed at answering the question: Does my husband spend an exorbitant amount of money at Philz Coffee? 

To answer this question, I obtained Philz App User data via the California Consumer Privacy Act for one user to anaylze and visualize the user data. Here are the steps you can take to replocate my project: 

  1. Contact Philz App to retrieve user data through the CCPA. 
      Here are the steps to request your data through the app: 
          More > Legal > Privacy Policy > Scroll down to 'Requests' 
                      OR
          visit: https://www.philzcoffee.com/policy
      Using these steps, any active Philz App user in California can request the data that the Philz app collects. The raw data set is uploaded in this repo.  
      
  2.  Download and install R and Rstudio. R is an open-source data analysis software. You can download R here: https://www.rstudio.com/ 

  3.  Download the raw Philz transaction data titles 'philz_dataset.csv' and the Rstudio code used to perform data cleaning titled 'philz_data_cleaning_code.r'
    
  4.  Run the RStudio code. Disclaimer: You may need to change the file path depending on where you save the raw datase on your computer.
    
  5.  Pull your exported dataset into Google Data Studio. More information on Google Data Studio can be found here: https://datastudio.google.com/
   
  6.  My finished dashboard using this data is found here: https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/b2b8bf63-c7ab-4327-963f-c09715bc1a11

This project challenged me to apply my RStudio coding skills and also contributed to learning Google Data Studio (this is my first Google Data Studio Project).
